In Week we began to make the final touches on the website. I was able to allow videos to pop up in the chatbot i have created and add text to speech to the chat bot. We werent able to intergrate our parts together to make a full cohesive website. But each of our parts work fine separately. Outside of getting all of the functions to work in the websitewe had to make an elevator pitch about the project. In order to do this we created a 60-90 second video explaining what code wiz intells and what were our intentions with creating code wiz. Laslty I am still working on the chatbot page and trying to add more modules to the lesson and add the image of dubbie on the web page. I would like for dubbie to be on the webpage so when the text to speech api begins to talk it will give the illusion that dubbie is the corner of the screen talking.
