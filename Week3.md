In week 3 our weekly goals were to complete our literature review and figma designs. For our Figma design, we all picked an app that we wanted to recreate, my app was Uber Eats. Uber Eats is a mobile app that allows you to order food from your local food spots. I had fun recreating the app and adding my spin to it to make it look more pleasing to the human eyes. This task did not take long for me, maybe because I was interested in recreating this app. 
As stated earlier we had to complete our literature review and make a PowerPoint about them to present to our teams. Creating the literature review was a little challenging. Trying to ensure I had retained all the information and truly understood the articles was a big challenge for me. Especially since I had to complete it in a week but I was able to find 3-5 articles that talked about the implementation of backend systems. Creating the PowerPoint was also challenging because you do not want to put everything on one slide but you also do not want it to be very vague having your audience confused, so this was very tricky for me. 
Even though we had a long week of work tasks like figma design, literature review, and completing coding assignments we did take a trip to John Hopkins APL lab. This trip was very informative. They allowed us to tour the building and gave us a presentation on some of the past projects that they have completed using AI along with some projects that they are currently working on and trying to improve. It was nice to see some of the projects but I would have liked more hands-on experience with the presentors. My favorite part of the trip was the brain stimulation and the robot dog.
