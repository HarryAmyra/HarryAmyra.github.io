In week 10 we presented our project for the final summer presentation. This is where all the groups get together and present their project. As we approach the last days i am truly grateful for this experience and the connections that I have made over the past 10 weeks. I am proud of the research and the work that i have achieved over htese weeks and proud to say that I will be walking away with new coding skills and knowledge.
