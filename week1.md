During the First week of CEAMLS I met with my project leader and team members. We briefly discussed what our project consisted of to ensure everyone was on point with the project. My team members are Emmanuel and Kye. I did not get to meet Kye but I did connect with Emmanuel it was great vibes and he seems very eager to learn and help with the project. My mentors are Dr. Naja Mack, Olabsi adewumi, and Michael Adeleke they all seem very nice.
Along with meeting everyone we took a placement test and were placed in groups based on our scores. In the beginning, I felt like I was placed in the wrong group but as the lesson went on I was grateful to be placed on the group because it was a refresher and made me realize I forgot many of the basics of coding. I started coding with Java and switched to Python once I transferred to Morgan and although I can interpret the codes when it comes to writing the code I begin to forget the basics in Python so it showed me what I needed to work on at home. Lastly, Dr. Mack asked me to help others in the lab with coding and even though I was teaching others how to code it was a great learning experience for me because I struggled with explaining work to others but by being forced to teach people during the coding bootcamp actually build my confindence with helping others and coding myself. I even began to help others when we started doing machine learning I was able to debug people codes and that also build my confindence with coding and python.
