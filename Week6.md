In week 6 I began coding for codewiz. Along with writing code for the website, I began practicing my presentation for the mid-summer symposium.
Practice presenting was harder than I expected. It made me realize how much I need to work on my public speaking. I also worked on perfecting the actual
PowerPoint slides that I will be presenting. By doing this I had to make sure my PowerPoint slides were easy to read by making my bullet points short but 
still very informative. Along with working on the PowerPoint slides My team and I decided on the web design we wanted to go with and then we combined some 
of the features from each person's website into one. We were able to fully prototype the website and record a video to explain each page of the website and 
display its Functions. I demonstrated how the mock-up would work on figma and how we picture the ITS system to work with the students.

We were supposed to present this week but we weren't able to show due to technical difficulties. Next week starts the summer camp for code bears and this is 
a summer camp for kids to learn how to code in grades 5th -9th. To participate in the summer camp I had to get my fingerprints taken at the cji center. Lastly,
we were given the chance to have a town hall discussion for all participants and mentors. in this town, we were allowed to voice our opinion on how
the internship was going and what things could have been improved in the internship.
