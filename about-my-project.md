## About My Project

My project, CodeWiz is a website that will help teach students how to code in Python based on how they learn. We will be doing this by implementing an AI that will help detect how each student learns based on their work on the website. Then it will use that data to help the AI adapt to the students' learning based on their learning behaviors.
