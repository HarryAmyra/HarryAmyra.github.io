## About My Project

My project, CodeWiz, is an innovative website designed to teach students how to code in Python by tailoring the learning experience to their individual learning styles. Our approach involves implementing advanced AI technology that analyzes each student's interactions and performance on the website. By understanding these patterns, the AI adapts the educational content and delivery methods to align with the unique learning behaviors of each student.

CodeWiz aims to create a personalized learning environment that enhances engagement and improves comprehension. The AI will assess various factors such as the pace at which students progress through lessons, the types of errors they commonly make, and their responses to different instructional methods. Based on this data, the AI will dynamically adjust the difficulty level of exercises, the style of explanations, and the format of quizzes to best suit each learner's needs.

This adaptive learning system ensures that students receive the support and challenges they need to develop their coding skills effectively. By providing a customized educational experience, CodeWiz helps students achieve a deeper understanding of Python programming and fosters a more enjoyable and productive learning journey.
