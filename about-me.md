## About Me
I am currently a junior at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation date in 2025. I transferred to Morgan State University to further my education and take advantage of the excellent opportunities available in their computer science program. 

Prior to this internship, I gained experience coding in Java, C++, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While I am still a beginner in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am eager to continue improving my skills in these areas. My background includes both self-directed learning and formal coursework, which has provided me with a solid foundation in programming and a passion for continuous learning and development in the field of computer science.
