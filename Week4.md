In week four I completed my Figma design of what I imagined code wiz to look like. So my team and I created mockups of the actual website and presented project groups and our mentors. we received feedback on how to improve our websites and make them more user-friendly. Creating the Figma design was not hard trying to figure out what to put on each page was very hard. I didn't want to overwhelm my users but I didn't want to leave it too vague. After receiving feedback I realized that my website design was out of date and that it may not look appealing to the user's eyes. 
Outside of the work that we did in the lab, we took a trip to explore the center of climate simulations and the geostationary extended observations. I would say this trip was okay i do not think the NASA team was very interactive and they did not show us much. It was a lot of talking and PowerPoint lectures it was informative but I began to zone out after a while.
