In week 2 we were able to dive deep into our projects. We were assigned multiple tasks to do on Asana. This week I have completed HTML and CSS course assignments. After completing the assignment we were all tasked to create a website based on the lessons we reviewed on Codecademy. We were given two or three days to make a partial website to display what we learned after week two.

When creating my partial website I ran into a few problems. Creating the HTML for the website was the easiest part but when it came to creating the CSS this is where the challenge came in. When you write certain codes in css it may not display exactly how you want it so you will have to do a lot of trial and error with your design. This part was a little frustrating because I had to delete and rewrite code multiple times. But once I figured it out it was very exciting. 
Along with creating a website, we had to upload videos by the end of the weekday that described our project. In this video, we discussed the weekly goals that we finished and what things we found challenging. Then we discussed what we are expecting to complete for next week's task. Overall this week was stressful, but I learned a lot and look forward to continuing my coding journey.
