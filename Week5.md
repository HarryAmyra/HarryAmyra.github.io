In week 5 I began to make changes to my mock-up for code wiz, I took the feedback that I was given and create a new mock design. This was very challenging for me and forced me to think outside the box. While creating the design I tried to make sure to incorporate a visual of the intelligent tutoring system and IDE for the students. I wanted to make sure viewers had the opportunity to see how the system would work with the students and adapt to their learning behaviors. I also tried to incorporate some of my findings from my literature review into my design.
Outside of the mockup I had the chance to test out toy robots for high school students that came around and shadowed our lab. We played red light green light, soccer, and other games with these robots. we controlled these toy cars with either a computer or an iPad. it was fun it allowed us to take a step back from our projects and decompress for a while. 
Next, we began to start presenting for our mid-summer presentation. We did practice presentations so that we could get back from our group members and other mentors before we have to present at the actual symposium next week. This allows us to work on our presentation over the weekend to prepare for next week.
