In week 7 my team and I had the opportunity to present our project in front of the institute. This was as nerve-wracking as I thought it would be. It was exciting to see what everyone has worked on and how much progress they have made.
Along with presenting my team and I began doing the code for code wiz, we have an IDE, a chatbot, and a working AI who you can physically see and talk to you. Even though we all have completed part of the project we still have to combine each other's parts separately. This part may be tricky because of the pacakage.json packages. This will require a lot of trial and error. 
Even though I was able to complete the task of creating the chatbot I have run into technical issues far as importing the openai, my computer does not allow me to use the pip command so unfortunately I have had to hard code questions into my chatbot. So this is a part that I am that I am currently stuck on and I am hoping to fix this issue by the end of this week. Besides that, I am currently working on adding a text-to-speech application to the chatbot and a button to change the font size of the text for those who are visually impaired. Hopefully next week we can combine all of our apps and have a fully functional ide, chatbot, and AI on one website. So that we can begin to add more pages to the front end.
